# Match Popup Feature Guide

## Overview
The match popup is a beautiful, animated celebration that appears when two users like each other (create a match). It provides an engaging user experience with animations, haptic feedback, and clear call-to-action buttons.

## Features

### ðŸŽ‰ Visual Effects
- **Spring Animation**: The popup scales in with a bouncy spring effect
- **Heart Animation**: A large heart icon scales up and down for emphasis
- **Text Slide**: Match text slides up from below
- **Confetti Effect**: Celebration icons appear with fade animation
- **Gradient Background**: Beautiful pink gradient background

### ðŸ“± Haptic Feedback
- **Initial Vibration**: Double vibration pattern when popup appears
- **Heart Vibration**: Single vibration when heart animates

### ðŸŽ¯ User Actions
- **Send Message**: Navigates to the Matches tab to start chatting
- **Keep Swiping**: Closes popup and continues to next profile

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`src/services/matchingService.ts`**
   - Added `checkForMatch()` function
   - Modified `recordSwipe()` to return match information
   - Automatically creates match when both users like each other

2. **`src/components/MatchPopup.tsx`** (New)
   - Complete match popup component with animations
   - Haptic feedback integration
   - Confetti effects

3. **`src/screens/SwipeScreen.tsx`**
   - Added match state management
   - Integrated match popup component
   - Added handlers for popup actions

### Match Detection Logic
```typescript
// When user A likes user B
1. Record swipe in database
2. Check if user B has already liked user A
3. If yes, create match and show popup
4. If no, continue to next profile
```

### Animation Sequence
1. **Popup appears** (scale + opacity)
2. **Haptic feedback** (vibration)
3. **Heart animates** (scale up/down)
4. **Text slides up** (translateY)
5. **Confetti appears** (fade in/out)

## Usage

### For Users
1. Swipe right on a profile you like
2. If they also liked you, the match popup appears
3. Choose to send a message or keep swiping
4. The match will appear in your Matches tab

### For Developers
The match popup automatically triggers when:
- A user swipes right (likes) someone
- The other user has already liked them
- A new match is created in the database

## Customization

### Colors
- Primary gradient: `['#ff6b6b', '#ff8e8e', '#ff6b6b']`
- Button gradient: `['#4CAF50', '#45a049']`
- Confetti colors: `#FFD700`, `#FF69B4`, `#00CED1`
